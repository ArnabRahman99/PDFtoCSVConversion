Simple script to take a PDF as input and use lattice, streaming, and image recognition libraries to convert into a csv accurately.

Well-structured means that the PDF has tables that are structured with lines and lattices. This is quite accurate.

Un-structured means that the PDF has no lines/lattices separating the different fields in the tables. The accuracy for this option is lower than well structured.
